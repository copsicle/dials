# Plane dials app
This is my first project with node.js and react, enjoy.

# Running
Requires node.js and npm.

 - Run npm install and npm start, the react client will get recompiled and the server will start afterwards.
 - Connect to your machine at port 8080.
 - Done!

# Todo
 - CSS animations

# Known issues
 - After the "press any key" prompt in the server the key inserted would roll over to the altitude input.
